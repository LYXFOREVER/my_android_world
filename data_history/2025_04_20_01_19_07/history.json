Based on user's goal/request, you may\n- Answer back if the request/goal is a question (or a chat message), like user asks \"What is my schedule for today?\".\n- Complete some tasks described in the requests/goals by performing actions (step by step) on the phone.\n\nWhen given a user request, you will try to complete it step by step. At each step, you will be given the current screenshot (including the original screenshot and the same screenshot with bounding boxes and numeric indexes added to some UI elements) and a history of what you have done (in text). Based on these pieces of information and the goal, you must choose to perform one of the action in the following list (action description followed by the JSON format) by outputing the action in the correct JSON format.\n- If you think the task has been completed, finish the task by using the status action with complete as goal_status: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"complete\"}`\n- If you think the task is not feasible (including cases like you don't have enough information or can not perform some necessary actions), finish by using the `status` action with infeasible as goal_status: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"infeasible\"}`\n- Answer user's question: `{\"action_type\": \"answer\", \"text\": \"<answer_text>\"}`\n- Click/tap on an element on the screen. We have added marks (bounding boxes with numeric indexes on their TOP LEFT corner) to most of the UI elements in the screenshot, use the numeric index to indicate which element you want to click: `{\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": <target_index>}`.\n- Long press on an element on the screen, similar with the click action above, use the numeric label on the bounding box to indicate which element you want to long press: `{\"action_type\": \"long_press\", \"index\": <target_index>}`.\n- Type text into a text field (this action contains clicking the text field, typing in the text and pressing the enter, so no need to click on the target field to start), use the numeric label on the bounding box to indicate the target text field: `{\"action_type\": \"input_text\", \"text\": <text_input>, \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Press the Enter key: `{\"action_type\": \"keyboard_enter\"}`\n- Navigate to the home screen: `{\"action_type\": \"navigate_home\"}`\n- Navigate back: `{\"action_type\": \"navigate_back\"}`\n- Scroll the screen or a scrollable UI element in one of the four directions, use the same numeric index as above if you want to scroll a specific UI element, leave it empty when scroll the whole screen: `{\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": <up, down, left, right>, \"index\": <optional_target_index>}`\n- Open an app (nothing will happen if the app is not installed): `{\"action_type\": \"open_app\", \"app_name\": <name>}`\n- Wait for the screen to update: `{\"action_type\": \"wait\"}`\n\nThe (overall) user goal/request is: Open the file task.html in Downloads in the file manager; when prompted open it with Chrome.

We have added marks (bounding boxes with numeric indexes on their TOP LEFT corner) to most of the UI elements in the screenshot, use the numeric index to indicate which element you want to click: `{\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": <target_index>}`.\n- Long press on an element on the screen, similar with the click action above, use the numeric label on the bounding box to indicate which element you want to long press: `{\"action_type\": \"long_press\", \"index\": <target_index>}`.\n- Type text into a text field (this action contains clicking the text field, typing in the text and pressing the enter, so no need to click on the target field to start), use the numeric label on the bounding box to indicate the target text field: `{\"action_type\": \"input_text\", \"text\": <text_input>, \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Press the Enter key: `{\"action_type\": \"keyboard_enter\"}`\n- Navigate to the home screen: `{\"action_type\": \"navigate_home\"}`\n- Navigate back: `{\"action_type\": \"navigate_back\"}`\n- Scroll the screen or a scrollable UI element in one of the four directions, use the same numeric index as above if you want to scroll a specific UI element, leave it empty when scroll the whole screen: `{\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": <up, down, left, right>, \"index\": <optional_target_index>}`\n- Open an app (nothing will happen if the app is not installed): `{\"action_type\": \"open_app\", \"app_name\": <name>}`\n- Wait for the screen to update: `{\"action_type\": \"wait\"}`\n\nThe (overall) user goal/request is: Open the file task.html in Downloads in the file manager; when prompted open it with Chrome. Then click the button 5 times, remember the numbers displayed, and enter their product in the form.\nBesides the actions I mention above, there possibly be other actions, which you dont need to careNow I want you to summerize the latest step.\nYou will be given the screenshot before you performed the action (which has a text label \"before\" on the bottom right), the action you chose (together with the reason) and the screenshot after the action was performed (which has a text label \"after\" on the bottom right).\nAlso here is the list of detailed information for some UI elements

This summary will be added to action history and used in future action selection, so try to include essential information you think that will be most useful for future action selections like what you intended to do, why, if it worked as expected, if not what might be the reason (be critical, the action/reason might be wrong), what should/should not be done next and so on. Some more rules/tips you should follow:\n- Keep it short (better less than 50 words) and in a single line\n- Some actions (like `answer`, `wait`) don't involve screen change, you can just assume they work as expected.\n- Given this summary will be added into action history, it can be used as memory to include information that needs to be remembered, or shared between different apps.\n\nSummary of this step: ",

At each step, you will be given the current screenshot (including the original screenshot and the same screenshot with bounding boxes and numeric indexes added to some UI elements) and a history of what you have done (in text). Based on these pieces of information and the goal, you must choose to perform one of the action in the following list (action description followed by the JSON format) by outputing the action in the correct JSON format.\n- If you think the task has been completed, finish the task by using the status action with complete as goal_status: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"complete\"}`\n- If you think the task is not feasible (including cases like you don't have enough information or can not perform some necessary actions), finish by using the `status` action with infeasible as goal_status: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"infeasible\"}`\n- Answer user's question: `{\"action_type\": \"answer\", \"text\": \"<answer_text>\"}`\n- Click/tap on an element on the screen. We have added marks (bounding boxes with numeric indexes on their TOP LEFT corner) to most of the UI elements in the screenshot, use the numeric index to indicate which element you want to click: `{\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": <target_index>}`.\n- Long press on an element on the screen, similar with the click action above, use the numeric label on the bounding box to indicate which element you want to long press: `{\"action_type\": \"long_press\", \"index\": <target_index>}`.\n- Type text into a text field (this action contains clicking the text field, typing in the text and pressing the enter, so no need to click on the target field to start), use the numeric label on the bounding box to indicate the target text field: `{\"action_type\": \"input_text\", \"text\": <text_input>, \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Press the Enter key: `{\"action_type\": \"keyboard_enter\"}`\n- Navigate to the home screen: `{\"action_type\": \"navigate_home\"}`\n- Navigate back: `{\"action_type\": \"navigate_back\"}`\n- Scroll the screen or a scrollable UI element in one of the four directions, use the same numeric index as above if you want to scroll a specific UI element, leave it empty when scroll the whole screen: `{\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": <up, down, left, right>, \"index\": <optional_target_index>}`\n- Open an app (nothing will happen if the app is not installed): `{\"action_type\": \"open_app\", \"app_name\": <name>}`\n- Wait for the screen to update: `{\"action_type\": \"wait\"}`\n\nThe (overall) user goal/request is: Open the file task.html in Downloads in the file manager; when prompted open it with Chrome.

This summary will be added to action history and used in future action selection, so try to include essential information you think that will be most useful for future action selections like what you intended to do, why, if it worked as expected, if not what might be the reason (be critical, the action/reason might be wrong), what should/should not be done next and so on. Some more rules/tips you should follow:\n- Keep it short (better less than 50 words) and in a single line\n- Some actions (like `answer`, `wait`) don't involve screen change, you can just assume they work as expected.\n- Given this summary will be added into action history, it can be used as memory to include information that needs to be remembered, or shared between different apps.\n\nSummary of this step: ",

At each step, you will be given the current screenshot (including the original screenshot and the same screenshot with bounding boxes and numeric indexes added to some UI elements) and a history of what you have done (in text). Based on these pieces of information and the goal, you must choose to perform one of the action in the following list (action description followed by the JSON format) by outputing the action in the correct JSON format.\n- If you think the task has been completed, finish the task by using the status action with complete as goal_status: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"complete\"}`\n- If you think the task is not feasible (including cases like you don't have enough information or can not perform some necessary actions), finish by using the `status` action with infeasible as goal_status: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"infeasible\"}`\n- Answer user's question: `{\"action_type\": \"answer\", \"text\": \"<answer_text>\"}`\n- Click/tap on an element on the screen. We have added marks (bounding boxes with numeric indexes on their TOP LEFT corner) to most of the UI elements in the screenshot, use the numeric index to indicate which element you want to click: `{\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": <target_index>}`.\n- Long press on an element on the screen, similar with the click action above, use the numeric label on the bounding box to indicate which element you want to long press: `{\"action_type\": \"long_press\", \"index\": <target_index>}`.\n- Type text into a text field (this action contains clicking the text field, typing in the text and pressing the enter, so no need to click on the target field to start), use the numeric label on the bounding box to indicate the target text field: `{\"action_type\": \"input_text\", \"text\": <text_input>, \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Press the Enter key: `{\"action_type\": \"keyboard_enter\"}`\n- Navigate to the home screen: `{\"action_type\": \"navigate_home\"}`\n- Navigate back: `{\"action_type\": \"navigate_back\"}`\n- Scroll the screen or a scrollable UI element in one of the four directions, use the same numeric index as above if you want to scroll a specific UI element, leave it empty when scroll the whole screen: `{\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": <up, down, left, right>, \"index\": <optional_target_index>}`\n- Open an app (nothing will happen if the app is not installed): `{\"action_type\": \"open_app\", \"app_name\": <name>}`\n- Wait for the screen to update: `{\"action_type\": \"wait\"}`\n\nThe (overall) user goal/request is: Open the file task.html in Downloads in the file manager; when prompted open it with Chrome.

Some more rules/tips you should follow:\n- Keep it short (better less than 50 words) and in a single line\n- Some actions (like `answer`, `wait`) don't involve screen change, you can just assume they work as expected.\n- Given this summary will be added into action history, it can be used as memory to include information that needs to be remembered, or shared between different apps.\n\nSummary of this step: ",

At each step, you will be given the current screenshot (including the original screenshot and the same screenshot with bounding boxes and numeric indexes added to some UI elements) and a history of what you have done (in text). Based on these pieces of information and the goal, you must choose to perform one of the action in the following list (action description followed by the JSON format) by outputing the action in the correct JSON format.\n- If you think the task has been completed, finish the task by using the status action with complete as goal_status: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"complete\"}`\n- If you think the task is not feasible (including cases like you don't have enough information or can not perform some necessary actions), finish by using the `status` action with infeasible as goal_status: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"infeasible\"}`\n- Answer user's question: `{\"action_type\": \"answer\", \"text\": \"<answer_text>\"}`\n- Click/tap on an element on the screen.

This summary will be added to action history and used in future action selection, so try to include essential information you think that will be most useful for future action selections like what you intended to do, why, if it worked as expected, if not what might be the reason (be critical, the action/reason might be wrong), what should/should not be done next and so on. Some more rules/tips you should follow:\n- Keep it short (better less than 50 words) and in a single line\n- Some actions (like `answer`, `wait`) don't involve screen change, you can just assume they work as expected.\n- Given this summary will be added into action history, it can be used as memory to include information that needs to be remembered, or shared between different apps.\n\nSummary of this step: ",

At each step, you will be given the current screenshot (including the original screenshot and the same screenshot with bounding boxes and numeric indexes added to some UI elements) and a history of what you have done (in text). Based on these pieces of information and the goal, you must choose to perform one of the action in the following list (action description followed by the JSON format) by outputing the action in the correct JSON format.\n- If you think the task has been completed, finish the task by using the status action with complete as goal_status: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"complete\"}`\n- If you think the task is not feasible (including cases like you don't have enough information or can not perform some necessary actions), finish by using the `status` action with infeasible as goal_status: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"infeasible\"}`\n- Answer user's question: `{\"action_type\": \"answer\", \"text\": \"<answer_text>\"}`\n- Click/tap on an element on the screen.

At each step, you will be given the current screenshot (including the original screenshot and the same screenshot with bounding boxes and numeric indexes added to some UI elements) and a history of what you have done (in text). Based on these pieces of information and the goal, you must choose to perform one of the action in the following list (action description followed by the JSON format) by outputing the action in the correct JSON format.\n- If you think the task has been completed, finish the task by using the status action with complete as goal_status: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"complete\"}`\n- If you think the task is not feasible (including cases like you don't have enough information or can not perform some necessary actions), finish by using the `status` action with infeasible as goal_status: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"infeasible\"}`\n- Answer user's question: `{\"action_type\": \"answer\", \"text\": \"<answer_text>\"}`\n- Click/tap on an element on the screen.

At each step, you will be given the current screenshot (including the original screenshot and the same screenshot with bounding boxes and numeric indexes added to some UI elements) and a history of what you have done (in text). Based on these pieces of information and the goal, you must choose to perform one of the action in the following list (action description followed by the JSON format) by outputing the action in the correct JSON format.\n- If you think the task has been completed, finish the task by using the status action with complete as goal_status: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"complete\"}`\n- If you think the task is not feasible (including cases like you don't have enough information or can not perform some necessary actions), finish by using the `status` action with infeasible as goal_status: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"infeasible\"}`\n- Answer user's question: `{\"action_type\": \"answer\", \"text\": \"<answer_text>\"}`\n- Click/tap on an element on the screen.

At each step, you will be given the current screenshot (including the original screenshot and the same screenshot with bounding boxes and numeric indexes added to some UI elements) and a history of what you have done (in text). Based on these pieces of information and the goal, you must choose to perform one of the action in the following list (action description followed by the JSON format) by outputing the action in the correct JSON format.\n- If you think the task has been completed, finish the task by using the status action with complete as goal_status: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"complete\"}`\n- If you think the task is not feasible (including cases like you don't have enough information or can not perform some necessary actions), finish by using the `status` action with infeasible as goal_status: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"infeasible\"}`\n- Answer user's question: `{\"action_type\": \"answer\", \"text\": \"<answer_text>\"}`\n- Click/tap on an element on the screen.

At each step, you will be given the current screenshot (including the original screenshot and the same screenshot with bounding boxes and numeric indexes added to some UI elements) and a history of what you have done (in text). Based on these pieces of information and the goal, you must choose to perform one of the action in the following list (action description followed by the JSON format) by outputing the action in the correct JSON format.\n- If you think the task has been completed, finish the task by using the status action with complete as goal_status: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"complete\"}`\n- If you think the task is not feasible (including cases like you don't have enough information or can not perform some necessary actions), finish by using the `status` action with infeasible as goal_status: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"infeasible\"}`\n- Answer user's question: `{\"action_type\": \"answer\", \"text\": \"<answer_text>\"}`\n- Click/tap on an element on the screen.

Some more rules/tips you should follow:\n- Keep it short (better less than 50 words) and in a single line\n- Some actions (like `answer`, `wait`) don't involve screen change, you can just assume they work as expected.\n- Given this summary will be added into action history, it can be used as memory to include information that needs to be remembered, or shared between different apps.\n\nSummary of this step: ",

At each step, you will be given the current screenshot (including the original screenshot and the same screenshot with bounding boxes and numeric indexes added to some UI elements) and a history of what you have done (in text). Based on these pieces of information and the goal, you must choose to perform one of the action in the following list (action description followed by the JSON format) by outputing the action in the correct JSON format.\n- If you think the task has been completed, finish the task by using the status action with complete as goal_status: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"complete\"}`\n- If you think the task is not feasible (including cases like you don't have enough information or can not perform some necessary actions), finish by using the `status` action with infeasible as goal_status: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"infeasible\"}`\n- Answer user's question: `{\"action_type\": \"answer\", \"text\": \"<answer_text>\"}`\n- Click/tap on an element on the screen.

At each step, you will be given the current screenshot (including the original screenshot and the same screenshot with bounding boxes and numeric indexes added to some UI elements) and a history of what you have done (in text). Based on these pieces of information and the goal, you must choose to perform one of the action in the following list (action description followed by the JSON format) by outputing the action in the correct JSON format.\n- If you think the task has been completed, finish the task by using the status action with complete as goal_status: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"complete\"}`\n- If you think the task is not feasible (including cases like you don't have enough information or can not perform some necessary actions), finish by using the `status` action with infeasible as goal_status: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"infeasible\"}`\n- Answer user's question: `{\"action_type\": \"answer\", \"text\": \"<answer_text>\"}`\n- Click/tap on an element on the screen.

At each step, you will be given the current screenshot (including the original screenshot and the same screenshot with bounding boxes and numeric indexes added to some UI elements) and a history of what you have done (in text). Based on these pieces of information and the goal, you must choose to perform one of the action in the following list (action description followed by the JSON format) by outputing the action in the correct JSON format.\n- If you think the task has been completed, finish the task by using the status action with complete as goal_status: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"complete\"}`\n- If you think the task is not feasible (including cases like you don't have enough information or can not perform some necessary actions), finish by using the `status` action with infeasible as goal_status: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"infeasible\"}`\n- Answer user's question: `{\"action_type\": \"answer\", \"text\": \"<answer_text>\"}`\n- Click/tap on an element on the screen.

Based on user's goal/request, you may\n- Answer back if the request/goal is a question (or a chat message), like user asks \"What is my schedule for today?\".\n- Complete some tasks described in the requests/goals by performing actions (step by step) on the phone.\n\nWhen given a user request, you will try to complete it step by step. At each step, you will be given the current screenshot (including the original screenshot and the same screenshot with bounding boxes and numeric indexes added to some UI elements) and a history of what you have done (in text). Based on these pieces of information and the goal, you must choose to perform one of the action in the following list (action description followed by the JSON format) by outputing the action in the correct JSON format.\n- If you think the task has been completed, finish the task by using the status action with complete as goal_status: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"complete\"}`\n- If you think the task is not feasible (including cases like you don't have enough information or can not perform some necessary actions), finish by using the `status` action with infeasible as goal_status: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"infeasible\"}`\n- Answer user's question: `{\"action_type\": \"answer\", \"text\": \"<answer_text>\"}`\n- Click/tap on an element on the screen.

At each step, you will be given the current screenshot (including the original screenshot and the same screenshot with bounding boxes and numeric indexes added to some UI elements) and a history of what you have done (in text). Based on these pieces of information and the goal, you must choose to perform one of the action in the following list (action description followed by the JSON format) by outputing the action in the correct JSON format.\n- If you think the task has been completed, finish the task by using the status action with complete as goal_status: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"complete\"}`\n- If you think the task is not feasible (including cases like you don't have enough information or can not perform some necessary actions), finish by using the `status` action with infeasible as goal_status: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"infeasible\"}`\n- Answer user's question: `{\"action_type\": \"answer\", \"text\": \"<answer_text>\"}`\n- Click/tap on an element on the screen.

At each step, you will be given the current screenshot (including the original screenshot and the same screenshot with bounding boxes and numeric indexes added to some UI elements) and a history of what you have done (in text). Based on these pieces of information and the goal, you must choose to perform one of the action in the following list (action description followed by the JSON format) by outputing the action in the correct JSON format.\n- If you think the task has been completed, finish the task by using the status action with complete as goal_status: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"complete\"}`\n- If you think the task is not feasible (including cases like you don't have enough information or can not perform some necessary actions), finish by using the `status` action with infeasible as goal_status: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"infeasible\"}`\n- Answer user's question: `{\"action_type\": \"answer\", \"text\": \"<answer_text>\"}`\n- Click/tap on an element on the screen.

Based on user's goal/request, you may\n- Answer back if the request/goal is a question (or a chat message), like user asks \"What is my schedule for today?\".\n- Complete some tasks described in the requests/goals by performing actions (step by step) on the phone.\n\nWhen given a user request, you will try to complete it step by step. At each step, you will be given the current screenshot (including the original screenshot and the same screenshot with bounding boxes and numeric indexes added to some UI elements) and a history of what you have done (in text). Based on these pieces of information and the goal, you must choose to perform one of the action in the following list (action description followed by the JSON format) by outputing the action in the correct JSON format.\n- If you think the task has been completed, finish the task by using the status action with complete as goal_status: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"complete\"}`\n- If you think the task is not feasible (including cases like you don't have enough information or can not perform some necessary actions), finish by using the `status` action with infeasible as goal_status: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"infeasible\"}`\n- Answer user's question: `{\"action_type\": \"answer\", \"text\": \"<answer_text>\"}`\n- Click/tap on an element on the screen. We have added marks (bounding boxes with numeric indexes on their TOP LEFT corner) to most of the UI elements in the screenshot, use the numeric index to indicate which element you want to click: `{\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": <target_index>}`.\n- Long press on an element on the screen, similar with the click action above, use the numeric label on the bounding box to indicate which element you want to long press: `{\"action_type\": \"long_press\", \"index\": <target_index>}`.\n- Type text into a text field (this action contains clicking the text field, typing in the text and pressing the enter, so no need to click on the target field to start), use the numeric label on the bounding box to indicate the target text field: `{\"action_type\": \"input_text\", \"text\": <text_input>, \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Press the Enter key: `{\"action_type\": \"keyboard_enter\"}`\n- Navigate to the home screen: `{\"action_type\": \"navigate_home\"}`\n- Navigate back: `{\"action_type\": \"navigate_back\"}`\n- Scroll the screen or a scrollable UI element in one of the four directions, use the same numeric index as above if you want to scroll a specific UI element, leave it empty when scroll the whole screen: `{\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": <up, down, left, right>, \"index\": <optional_target_index>}`\n- Open an app (nothing will happen if the app is not installed): `{\"action_type\": \"open_app\", \"app_name\": <name>}`\n- Wait for the screen to update: `{\"action_type\": \"wait\"}`\n\nThe (overall) user goal/request is: Open the file task.html in Downloads in the file manager; when prompted open it with Chrome.

This action is necessary to ensure that the app is responsive and ready to proceed with the task of opening the file task.html in the Downloads folder. The tap is expected to be a quick and precise action, ensuring that the app does not become unresponsive or lose focus. The goal is to confirm the app's activity and prepare for the next steps in the task. The action is likely to be successful, as it is a common and straightforward way to ensure app responsiveness. The time taken for this action is expected to be minimal, as it is a simple tap on the screen. The location of the tap is likely to be on the screen, as it is a tap action. The next step is to confirm that the app is active and ready for further navigation.",

Based on user's goal/request, you may\n- Answer back if the request/goal is a question (or a chat message), like user asks \"What is my schedule for today?\".\n- Complete some tasks described in the requests/goals by performing actions (step by step) on the phone.\n\nWhen given a user request, you will try to complete it step by step. At each step, you will be given the current screenshot (including the original screenshot and the same screenshot with bounding boxes and numeric indexes added to some UI elements) and a history of what you have done (in text). Based on these pieces of information and the goal, you must choose to perform one of the action in the following list (action description followed by the JSON format) by outputing the action in the correct JSON format.\n- If you think the task has been completed, finish the task by using the status action with complete as goal_status: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"complete\"}`\n- If you think the task is not feasible (including cases like you don't have enough information or can not perform some necessary actions), finish by using the `status` action with infeasible as goal_status: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"infeasible\"}`\n- Answer user's question: `{\"action_type\": \"answer\", \"text\": \"<answer_text>\"}`\n- Click/tap on an element on the screen. We have added marks (bounding boxes with numeric indexes on their TOP LEFT corner) to most of the UI elements in the screenshot, use the numeric index to indicate which element you want to click: `{\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": <target_index>}`.\n- Long press on an element on the screen, similar with the click action above, use the numeric label on the bounding box to indicate which element you want to long press: `{\"action_type\": \"long_press\", \"index\": <target_index>}`.\n- Type text into a text field (this action contains clicking the text field, typing in the text and pressing the enter, so no need to click on the target field to start), use the numeric label on the bounding box to indicate the target text field: `{\"action_type\": \"input_text\", \"text\": <text_input>, \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Press the Enter key: `{\"action_type\": \"keyboard_enter\"}`\n- Navigate to the home screen: `{\"action_type\": \"navigate_home\"}`\n- Navigate back: `{\"action_type\": \"navigate_back\"}`\n- Scroll the screen or a scrollable UI element in one of the four directions, use the same numeric index as above if you want to scroll a specific UI element, leave it empty when scroll the whole screen: `{\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": <up, down, left, right>, \"index\": <optional_target_index>}`\n- Open an app (nothing will happen if the app is not installed): `{\"action_type\": \"open_app\", \"app_name\": <name>}`\n- Wait for the screen to update: `{\"action_type\": \"wait\"}`\n\nThe (overall) user goal/request is: Open the file task.html in Downloads in the file manager; when prompted open it with Chrome.

the reason: To proceed with the task of opening the file task.html in the Downloads folder, I need to confirm that the file manager app is active and ready for further navigation. The previous action of tapping on the screen was likely intended to ensure the app's responsiveness. Now, I will confirm that the app is active and ready to proceed with the next steps, which involve opening the file in Chrome.\n\nBy comparing the two screenshots (plus the UI element lists) and the action performed, give a brief summary of this step. This summary will be added to action history and used in future action selection, so try to include essential information you think that will be most useful for future action selections like what you intended to do, why, if it worked as expected, if not what might be the reason (be critical, the action/reason might be wrong), what should/should not be done next and so on. Some more rules/tips you should follow:\n- Keep it short (better less than 50 words) and in a single line\n- Some actions (like `answer`, `wait`) don't involve screen change, you can just assume they work as expected.\n- Given this summary will be added into action history, it can be used as memory to include information that needs to be remembered, or shared between different apps.\n\nSummary of this step: ",
